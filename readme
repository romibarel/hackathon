Hello cool and dear testers,
First of all we really want to thank you for staying up late with us, it is really appreciated!
Second, we want to let you know that we were not aware of the fact that we were supposed to create branches 
in the git and commit separately.
We both worked on the same computer together - in the same room even!
Hence the lack of branches and commits from Inbar's github account.

Thank you, have a lovely day
Eat a lot of fondu (or pizza)
(unless you're alergic to dairy, we want you to live)
Inbar and Romi
